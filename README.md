# Shopify frontend challenge
Given the promt, we were told to make a front end application based on the nasa api where we could get as creative as we wanted. I implmented the mian feature along with a load feature which will show a loading animation while waiting for the api to come in. 

This project was built using react.js, react-routert-dom, along with bootstrap and the nasa api.
